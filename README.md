# Formal Verification of Smart Contracts

This is the start page about my efforts around smart contract verification.

## Goal

The goal is to establish a method how to verify a smart contract so that
no surprises happen after the deployment.

## Strategies

### Verify EVM Byteodes (Currently Being Followed)

The current attempt in Coq is in [evmverif](https://github.com/pirapira/evmverif/) repository.

#### Obstacles

* Coq proofs are currently [lengthy](https://github.com/pirapira/evmverif/blob/master/coq/example/managed_account_with_accumulators.v#L405).
    - I believe Isabelle/HOL provides much easier user experience (because it has a well-polished machine word library).  I'm porting the Coq attempt [into Isabelle/HOL](https://github.com/pirapira/eth-isabelle) (70% done within 2 days).
* At the bytecode level, it's harder to see what the code is doing and what to expect.
    - One solution is to make the Solidity compiler [annotate the bytecode](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/1178) with the expected properties at specific code location.
* At the bytecode level, Solidity array access looks like storage access with Kaccek hashes, and somehow we need to assume no collisions.  If I assume `âˆ€ a, b. keccak(a) = keccak(b) -> a = b`, using the pidgeon hole argument, I can prove `0 = 1` and everything.
    - I can locally say `sorry` or `admit` to indicate that I give up proofs whenever I have to prove `keccak(a) != keccak(b)` because `a != b`.  Then the proofs would be incomplete and I cannot call my results "theorems", but I'm happy that way.  Anyway the compiler assumes no hash collisions without logical justification (but empirical).
	- The module system of Coq provides [a clever workaround](https://github.com/bitemyapp/ledgertheory/blob/master/CryptoHashes.v).

#### Steps on this path

1. try Isabelle/HOL to see if proofs are really 5 times easier there
2. choose Coq or Isabelle/HOL
3. verify `Deed` and some other simple bytecode programs against simple properties
4. develop a method how to verify assertions between opcodes (this is [evmverif#5](https://github.com/pirapira/evmverif/issues/5))
5. modify Solidity to output such assertions between opcodes
6. verify the name registrar for some desired safety properties


### Verify Solidity Programs (This One Takes Longer Time)

One way would be to veryfy Solidity sources somehow,
not looking at the EVM bytecode.

#### Obstacles

* The only way to know the meaning of a Solidity program is to compile it into bytecodes.
* The Solidity compiler is changing fast and the verification tools would need to follow the changes

#### Steps on this path

The steps that have to be taken:

1. Know Solidity program's meaning without checking the bytecode.  For this, one way is to write a Solidity interpreter in OCaml or SML.  Another way is to compile a Solidity program into WhyML or F*.
2. Check the above against the reality.  We need a big set of tests to compare the above translation against the bytecode.


### A Safe Programming Language

The [bamboo copiler](https://github.com/pirapira/bamboo) is now producing snippets of bytecode for the empty contract (still lots to be done).

The language has
* no loops
    - this makes life much easier for static analyzers
    - gas consumption is stabler
    - users would need to call it again and again
* persistent program counter
    - this discourages multiple workflows in a single contract
    - reentrancy does not jump to far away in the source code, but reentrancy arrives around the last sentence executed
* protection against reentrancy
* explcit storage setting at every exit

It is inspired by an existing language but I will talk about it when it's actually working.
